# electron-quick-start-typescript

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) port of the [Electron Quick Start repo](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) -- a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.ts` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

## To Use

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# To recompile automatically
npm run watch
# Run the app
npm start
```
